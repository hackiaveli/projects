TO RUN: first run make, then either make your own test script and provide as the argument by running ./timetrash “name_script.sh” or you can use the simple one provided called test.sh for sample execution of many simple commands

works for most commands, when using redirect, see test.sh for correct syntax, it should be in the form of ls>file.txt without spaces
